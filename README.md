# Cospatial and Cotemporal alignment of SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI image data
The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft images the the solar corona in multiple wavelengths. These images reveal coronal activity which are primarily driven by magnetic fields. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO is another instrument which takes measurements of the magnetic fields on the solar surface. Both these data products are often used in tandem. However the spatial resolution of these data products products differ, as well as the times of observation. This repository uses Sunpy to degrade the resolution of SDO/AIA to match that of SDO/HMI by using images which are closest in time.
